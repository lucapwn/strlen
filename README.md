## About

The [strlen()](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.1?topic=functions-strlen-determine-string-length) function is responsible for calculating the size of a string. This function is available in some programming languages, such as C/C++ and PHP.

The example described here is a CLI (Command Line Interface) software developed in the x86 Assembly language.

## Support

The software is currently only available for the GNU/Linux operating system.

In the near future, I will include support for the Windows operating system.

## Dependencies

## Running
